# Power-System-Fault-Detection-Classification

-  A machine learning project to detect and classify faults in a power distribution system using voltage and current phasor data. Built using IBM Watson Studio AutoAI and deployed on IBM Cloud Lite for real-time 
   fault prediction and classification.
- This project focuses on detecting and classifying various types of power system faults such as Line Breakage, Overheating, Transformer Failure, line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults using 
  electrical measurement data. The model is trained using IBM Watson AutoAI and deployed via IBM Watson Machine Learning. It enables real-time, automated fault identification to improve power grid reliability. The 
  dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, and the project includes model training, deployment, testing, and result analysis.
